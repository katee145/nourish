# Nourish
![Nourish header](assets/images/header-nourish.png)

## Introduction 

Nourish is an attractive and user-friendly web application built to share and discover delicious recipes. The site allows authorised users to log in and publish recipes to Nourish, and allows site visitors to browse recipes for that all-too-needed meal inspo. This Full Stack Individual Capstone Project marks the culmination of everything learnt while studying at the Code Institute. Nourish combines and demonstrates:

* Frontend Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Backend Development: Django web framework
* Database Management: Django
* Agile Methodology: Project planning and tracking using Agile principles
* Version Control: Git & GitHub
* AI Integration: Exploring the potential of AI tools in the development process.

## UX Design

### Site Ownerâ€™s Goal

The site owner's goal is to build a user-friendly online platform that inspires and excites users to try new recipes from a range of creators. Nourish will foster a sense of community through user interactions, such as recipe reviews and feedback, to create a site that users will want to keep coming back to.

Whilst Nourish provides users with a curated collection of delicious recipes, the site will also foster a sense of community through user interactions, such as recipe reviews and feedback. Nourish will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python to create a site that users will want to keep coming back to.

### User Stories

The full user stories for this project as well as their acceptance criteria and tasks can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/users/katee145/projects/13" target="_blank">project board</a>. Below are the user-stories that were considered essential to making the minimum viable product:

* As a site visitor, I want to be able to access the recipe website on multiple devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) so that I can use it anytime, anywhere.
* As a recipe website administrator, I want to be able to easily add, edit, and delete recipes so that I can keep the content fresh and up-to-date.
* As a recipe website administrator, I want to be able to moderate user-generated content so that I can ensure the quality and appropriateness of reviews and comments.
* As a site visitor, I want to be able to easily browse and find recipes so that I can discover new and delicious dishes.
* As a user with dietary restrictions, I want to be able to filter recipes so that I can easily find recipes that are suitable for my needs.
* As a user looking for useful recipes, I want to be able to view detailed recipe information so that I can easily follow the instructions and understand the ingredients.
* As someone who has used a recipe, I want to be able to contribute to the recipe website by submitting my comments as feedback after making a recipe.

### Branding
![Branding slide for nourish](assets/images/branding-nourish.png)

#### Fonts

This project used 'Bowlby One' as the heading font and 'Open Sans' as the body font. Both of these fonts are available via Google Fonts and there is a backup of 'sans-serif' applied on the site.

#### Colour Palette

The colour palette for Nourish was carefully selected to align with the brand's purpose as a recipe site. The colours ensure a user-friendly experience with both attractiveness and meeting accessibility standards.

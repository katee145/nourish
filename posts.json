Remove the steak from the marinade and let it come to room temperature for about 10 minutes. 5. Grill the steak for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, or longer for your desired level of doneness. 6. Let the steak rest for 5 minutes before slicing thinly against the grain. 7. Warm the taco tortillas in a dry skillet or on the grill for about 30 seconds per side. 8. To assemble the tacos, place a few slices of carne asada on each tortilla. Top with thinly sliced red onion, avocado slices, fresh cilantro, and a squeeze of lime. 9. Optional: Add a dollop of sour cream and a spoonful of salsa for extra creaminess and flavor. 10.

Once the potatoes have cooled, add the flour, egg, salt, and pepper. Mix gently to form a dough, but don’t overwork it. Divide the dough into portions and roll each portion into long logs, then cut them into small bite-sized pieces. Press a fork lightly into each piece to form grooves. 3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the gnocchi into the boiling water in batches. Once they float to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside. 4. In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and spinach, cooking until the spinach wilts, about 3 minutes. 5. Add the crumbled feta to the spinach mixture, then add the cooked gnocchi. Toss gently to combine. 6. In a separate pan, melt the butter and add lemon zest. Once the butter is sizzling and fragrant, pour it over the gnocchi and spinach mixture. Toss everything together to coat evenly in the buttery sauce. 7. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper, if needed. 8. Serve immediately, garnished with additional crumbled feta if desired.",

        "instructions": "1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). 2. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing for 3-4 minutes until softened and fragrant. 3. Add the broccoli florets and cook for another 5-7 minutes until tender but still bright green. Stir in the spinach and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until wilted. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool slightly. 4. In a large bowl, combine the sautéed vegetables with the crumbled feta, ricotta cheese, beaten egg, lemon zest, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Stir until well combined. 5. Brush a baking dish with a tablespoon of olive oil. Lay one sheet of phyllo dough into the dish, brushing it with olive oil, and repeat this process, layering and brushing each sheet until you have 5-6 layers. 6. Spread the vegetable and cheese mixture evenly over the phyllo dough. 7. Continue layering and brushing phyllo dough sheets over the filling, using 5-6 more sheets to cover the top. Tuck in the edges to seal the filling inside. 8. Brush the top layer with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. 9. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the phyllo dough is golden brown and crispy. 10. Allow the spanakopita to cool for a few minutes before slicing into squares or wedges. Serve warm and enjoy the flaky, cheesy goodness!",

These light, airy pancakes are a delightful treat when topped with a colorful array of fresh fruit and a drizzle of maple syrup. The sweet strawberries, blueberries, and banana slices complement the soft, pillowy pancakes, creating a wholesome and satisfying breakfast or brunch.",
        "instructions": "1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. 2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg, then add the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Stir until the wet ingredients are combined. 3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; the batter should still have some lumps. 4. Heat a griddle or large non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly grease with a bit of butter or cooking spray. 5. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook for 2-3 minutes until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through. 6. Repeat with the remaining batter, keeping the pancakes warm by covering them with a clean kitchen towel. 7. Serve the pancakes topped with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and banana slices. Drizzle with maple syrup if desired. Enjoy your fluffy, fruity breakfast!",
